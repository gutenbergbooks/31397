<h2>REMARKS.</h2>


<p>This tragedy was dedicated to the Earl of Chesterfield, who was the
author's patron, and who, it is supposed, assisted him in the
composition of the work.</p>

<p>There are two tragedies under the title of "The Earl of Essex;" but the
following, by Henry Jones, brought upon the stage in 1753, was most
favourably received, and became very attractive.</p>

<p>The dramatist, who founds his plot and incidents on history, generally
adds, from his invention, those scenes, which best describe the power of
love. Here it has been otherwise, at least in the character of the
queen; whom every distinguished historian has portrayed as more
enamoured of her favourite Essex, than even this play will exhibit.</p>

<p>The character of Essex is sustained with greater accuracy:&mdash;the fiery
quality of his temper; his alternate pride and humility, daring and
servility, in presence of his royal mistress; with all his boisterous
vows of loyalty to her; and tender oaths of love to another.</p>

<p>The few characters which compose this drama, all claim an interest with
the reader, were it but from their mere names. The great Sir Walter
Raleigh is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> of the least importance among the dramatic group; and yet
his appearance causes an association of ideas, that makes every line he
utters valuable, for the sake of his reputation, and his impending
misfortunes.</p>

<p>The admirers of Shakspeare will likewise feel a double concern in the
fate of the Lord Southampton, whilst they recollect, that this zealous
friend of Essex was the noble protector and benefactor of England's most
illustrious bard.</p>

<p>The name of Burleigh sounds high as that of Elizabeth, for their glory
was equal&mdash;but the name alone attaches to the present character; for the
great Cecil, by the wisdom of whose measures England was, at the period
of this play, in its highest prosperity, died about two years previous
to the death of Essex; and this, his son, became the unhappy earl's
bitterest foe.</p>

<p>Not even a female character is here introduced from fiction.&mdash;Rutland
and Nottingham are both well known in history; and though the cruel
incident of the ring is not attested by any historian, it is minutely
related by them all.</p>

<p>But whether her majesty gave the unfortunate hero of this tragedy a ring
or not, it is most certain that she gave him a blow; and of all the
proofs of love which she bestowed upon him, this surely cannot be
numbered amongst the least.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary, that the present play, having introduced this
singular occurrence, should omit the particular sentence which Essex
uttered on the memorable occasion.&mdash;History says, that he laid his hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
on his sword, and told Elizabeth, "he would not have taken such
treatment from her father, Henry the Eighth."&mdash;But, as a man of true
gallantry, the Earl should not have felt himself offended at a woman's
anger; which experience must have told him, was the certain mark of
concealed tenderness. His reply had been most excellent had it been
delivered with smiles instead of frowns; but to have recourse to his
sword, was acting like a novice in the art of love; and resenting an
affront, when he should have acknowledged a favour.</p>

<p>As that love which is expressed by indirect means, has often the
greatest hold upon the attention and sympathy of the spectator; so, many
an auditor and reader will feel more interest in the restrained
affection of Elizabeth for her paramour, than in the unbridled fondness
of Rutland for her husband.&mdash;The scene, where the queen bestows the
ring, as a pledge of her kindest regard for his safety, is peculiarly
affecting, because the strength of her passion is there discoverable,
under a demeanour properly dignified; and all violent propensity, either
to esteem or resentment, is strictly governed by the consideration of
her own exalted rank.</p>

<p>In depicting the affliction, which the queen endured upon the execution
of Essex, and more especially at the news that he had implored her mercy
in vain, the dramatist has fallen infinitely below the historian. Hume
relates, that when Nottingham, having in her last illness requested to
see the queen, revealed her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> fatal secret, and entreated her majesty's
forgiveness, the queen shook the dying countess in her bed, and
exclaimed&mdash;"God may forgive you, but I never will." The most dismal
melancholy, as it is alleged, succeeded this rage.&mdash;But, from whatever
cause, it is certain that an almost unheard-of despondency concluded the
reign of this great princess, whose mind was masculine; and who,
throughout her long career of government, never evinced one feminine
weakness, which was not the effect of love, or of that vanity, which
hoped to inspire the passion.</p>

<p>At this era, in the short space of two years, the hand of death snatched
from the court of Great Britain, all these its most remarkable
personages&mdash;Essex, Nottingham, and the queen. It is probable, that the
decease of the first, hastened that of the second, as well as of the
last, character; for the countess's remorse for political stratagem is
reported to have been dreadfully severe.</p>

<p>The earl died in his thirty-fourth, and the queen in her seventieth
year.&mdash;In a subject, her majesty's unseasonable love might have formed a
comic, instead of a tragic, drama.</p>
